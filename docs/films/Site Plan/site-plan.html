			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to view and rate films to see which ones people like 
                and dislike. This site will help to guide them to movies that are top rated and will
                bring the most joy.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for this site is anyone who loves movies and is looking for something 
               good to watch.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I would like to add a search function to search for the titles of different films. 
                Similar to the recipe book site, I would also like to use javascript to create 
                "cards" for each film with all the information about it. When the page is loaded, 
                a random film card would be featured.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<hr />
			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>

			<h3>About Page</h3>
			<p>
                This page will be about me, the author of the site, as well as a little about the site itself.
                
                My name is Joshua Kakuschke, thank you for checking out my Top Films website. For 
                as long as I have been alive, I have had a passion for film. I love watching movies 
                and experiencing a whole story and falling in love with its characters. I also hope 
                to one day create films of my own. On this site, I share honest reviews, 
                recommendations, and reflections on films new and old. 

                My Top 5 films: [posters for each of the 5 films]
